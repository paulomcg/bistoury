## Next Steps
With Task 11 completed, the next logical step toward historical paper trading is **Task 12: Trader Agent (LLM Decision Engine)**, which will implement the intelligent decision-making layer that uses LLM analysis to make final trading decisions based on the signals from our candlestick strategy.

The Position Manager is now ready to execute trades and manage positions when integrated with:
- Task 12: Trader Agent for intelligent decision making
- Task 13: Paper Trading System for risk-free testing
- Task 18: Backtesting Engine for historical analysis

## Status: âœ… COMPLETE
All requirements for Task 11 have been successfully implemented, tested, and validated. The Position Manager Agent is production-ready and fully integrated with the Bistoury trading system architecture.
