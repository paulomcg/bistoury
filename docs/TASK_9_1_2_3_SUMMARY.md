## Technical Architecture

### Bootstrap Strategy Implementation
The implementation follows the dual-path processing architecture:

1. **Mathematical Path (Phase 1)**: Production-ready signal aggregation using mathematical algorithms
2. **Narrative Preservation**: Complete TradingNarrative storage for future Phase 2 temporal evolution

### Key Features

**Signal Aggregation:**
- Weighted averaging with strategy importance and confidence factors
- Conflict detection with severity calculation and resolution strategies  
- Quality scoring combining consensus, confidence, conflicts, and temporal consistency
- Dynamic weight adjustment based on strategy performance metrics
- Signal deduplication with temporal coherence validation

**Narrative System:**
- Complete narrative timeline preservation for TradingNarrative objects
- Advanced compression with adaptive algorithms based on narrative complexity
- Fast indexing system for multi-dimensional retrieval
- Continuity tracking builds coherent narrative stories
- Background archival with configurable policies

**Production Capabilities:**
- Real-time signal processing with sub-second latency optimization
- Multi-strategy coordination with configurable weighting schemes
- Performance-based weight adjustment with success rate tracking
- Quality grading system (A+ to F) with tradeable threshold enforcement
- Comprehensive error handling and type safety throughout
