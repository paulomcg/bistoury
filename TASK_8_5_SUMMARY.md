# Task 8.5: Pattern Strength and Confidence Scoring - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 8.5 successfully implemented a sophisticated pattern scoring system that evaluates candlestick patterns across multiple dimensions to provide reliable trading confidence scores. The system combines technical analysis, volume confirmation, market context, and historical performance to generate comprehensive pattern assessments.

## Core Implementation

### üìÅ Files Created
- **`src/bistoury/strategies/pattern_scoring.py`** (843 lines) - Complete scoring engine implementation
- **`tests/unit/test_pattern_scoring.py`** (1000+ lines) - Comprehensive test suite

### üß© Core Components

#### 1. TechnicalScoring Class
Evaluates technical criteria specific to each pattern type:
- **Body Size Scoring**: Pattern-specific body size validation (Doji prefers small, Marubozu prefers large)
- **Shadow Ratio Scoring**: Shadow proportion analysis (Hammer needs long lower shadow)
- **Price Position Scoring**: Close position relative to high/low range
- **Symmetry Scoring**: Multi-candle pattern symmetry evaluation
- **Textbook Compliance**: How well pattern matches theoretical definitions

#### 2. VolumeScoring Class
Provides volume confirmation analysis:
- **Volume Spike Detection**: Identifies above-average volume during pattern formation
- **Volume Trend Analysis**: Evaluates volume trend alignment with pattern direction
- **Breakout Volume Confirmation**: Validates breakout patterns with volume
- **Relative Volume Scoring**: Compares pattern volume to historical averages

#### 3. MarketContextScoring Class
Evaluates environmental factors affecting pattern reliability:
- **Trend Alignment**: Pattern alignment with broader market trend
- **Volatility Regime**: Optimal volatility ranges for pattern reliability
- **Market Session Timing**: Session-based scoring (London/NY overlap: 100, Off-hours: 40)
- **Support/Resistance Proximity**: Distance to key technical levels
- **Momentum Analysis**: Price momentum confirmation

#### 4. HistoricalPerformance Class
Tracks pattern success rates and reliability:
- **Success Rate Calculation**: Historical win/loss tracking by pattern type
- **Confidence Multipliers**: Sample size-based confidence adjustments
- **Average Performance Metrics**: Profit/loss and duration tracking
- **Reliability Scoring**: Overall pattern reliability assessment

#### 5. CompositePatternScore Class
Combines all scoring factors with sophisticated weighting:
- **Weighted Confidence Score**: Composite score from all factors (30% technical, 25% volume, 25% context, 20% historical)
- **Pattern Strength Classification**: very_weak ‚Üí very_strong based on confidence thresholds
- **Tradeable Threshold**: Patterns scoring 60+ considered tradeable
- **Risk-Adjusted Confidence**: Volatility and trend-based risk adjustments

#### 6. PatternScoringEngine Class
Main orchestration engine:
- **Pattern-Specific Logic**: Customized scoring algorithms per pattern type
- **Market Session Analysis**: UTC-based session awareness and scoring
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient multi-pattern scoring capabilities
- **Performance Tracking**: Historical outcome recording and analysis

## Technical Features

### üéØ Pattern-Specific Scoring
- **Doji**: Emphasizes small body size and shadow balance
- **Hammer**: Requires long lower shadow and close near high
- **Shooting Star**: Needs long upper shadow and close near low
- **Marubozu**: Validates large body with minimal shadows
- **General Patterns**: Moderate body size and balanced shadows

### ‚è∞ Market Session Awareness
```
UTC Sessions and Scores:
- London/NY Overlap (13:00-16:00): 100 points
- London Session (08:00-16:00): 90 points  
- New York Session (13:00-21:00): 85 points
- Asian Session (22:00-08:00): 70 points
- Off Hours (21:00-22:00): 40 points
```

### üìä Multi-Factor Integration
- **Technical Weight**: 30% - Core pattern validation
- **Volume Weight**: 25% - Confirmation analysis  
- **Context Weight**: 25% - Market environment
- **Historical Weight**: 20% - Success rate data

### üéöÔ∏è Confidence Thresholds
```
Pattern Strength Classification:
- 0-29: Very Weak
- 30-49: Weak
- 50-69: Moderate  
- 70-89: Strong
- 90-100: Very Strong

Tradeable Threshold: 60+ (is_tradeable = true)
```
