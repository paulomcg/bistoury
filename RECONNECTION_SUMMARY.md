# WebSocket Reconnection System - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Problem Solved

**Issue**: HyperLiquid WebSocket connections drop when network is disconnected, but the system wasn't automatically reconnecting.

**Root Cause**: The original error detection only caught explicit WebSocket errors in message handlers, but network disconnections often result in "silent failures" where the WebSocket appears connected but no messages flow.

## ðŸ”§ Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Detection
- **Message Handler Monitoring**: Track error patterns in WebSocket message callbacks
- **Message Flow Monitoring**: NEW - Monitor message timestamps to detect silent failures  
- **Connection Health Tracking**: Combined error detection with flow monitoring

### 2. Automatic Reconnection Loop
- **Exponential Backoff**: 1s â†’ 2s â†’ 4s â†’ 8s â†’ ... up to 60s
- **Jitter**: Â±25% randomization to prevent thundering herd
- **Subscription Recovery**: Automatically restore all active subscriptions
- **State Management**: Proper cleanup and restoration of connection state

### 3. Message Flow Monitoring (NEW)
- **Timeout Detection**: Flag connection as dead if no messages for 30s (configurable)
- **Subscription Awareness**: Only monitors when subscriptions are active
- **Silent Failure Detection**: Catches network disconnections that don't trigger errors

## ðŸ§ª Testing

To test the reconnection system:

```bash
python test_websocket_reconnection.py
```

Then disconnect your network for 15+ seconds and watch automatic reconnection.

## ðŸš€ Usage

The system works automatically - no configuration needed:

```python
client = HyperLiquidIntegration(config)
await client.connect()
await client.subscribe_all_mids(handler)
# Network issues now handled automatically
```

This ensures reliable real-time data feeds regardless of network conditions.
